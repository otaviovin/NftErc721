# SimpleNFT - Smart Contract for ERC721 NFTs

**SimpleNFT** is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC721 standard for creating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This contract allows users to mint, transfer, and manage NFTs easily while providing full control over the token ownership and metadata.

## Features

- **Minting NFTs**: The contract allows the owner to mint new NFTs to specified addresses.
- **Ownership Tracking**: You can retrieve the list of all tokens owned by any address.
- **Manual Token Transfers**: A function that allows the owner to manually update ownership mapping when transferring tokens.
- **Security**: Built using OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC721 and Ownable contracts for secure and reliable operations.
